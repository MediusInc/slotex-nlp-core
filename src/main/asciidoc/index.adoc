== Project founders

The program PKP or Po kreativni poti do praktiƒçnega znanja or Taking a creative
path to practical knowledge connects universities and commercial partners and
thus allows students to gain experience in the field, additional knowledge and
abilities which are increasingly more important when entering a job market and
starting a career. Students research creative and innovative solutions to
challenges posed by the economy and society.

The program cofinances projects lasting from 3 to 5 months that include 4 to 8
students and their mentors.  SloTex is one of 133 projects participating in the
second opening of the project between the years of 2017 and 2020.
